The target must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or have the &amp;Reference[Restrained] condition until it escapes. The target succeeds automatically if it's Huge or larger. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach from the Net on a successful check.</p><p><em><strong>Detect and Disarm.</strong></em> As a Search action, a creature can examine the trapped area and make a [[/check prc 11]] check, detecting the trip wire and the suspended @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.phbagNet00000000]{Net} on a successful check. Once detected, the trip wire can be easily cut or avoided (no ability check required).</p><p><em><strong>Destroy the Net.</strong></em> Reducing the Net to 0 Hit Points frees any creature trapped in it (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbEquipment0000.JournalEntryPage.xIDcbjgXOndS8zRl]{Adventuring Gear} for the Net's statistics).</p><p><em><strong>Set the Trap.</strong></em> A creature that has Thieves' Tools and all the trap's components (including a Net) can try to set a falling net trap, doing so with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Each attempt to set this trap takes 10 minutes.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the weight of the Net, which increases the save DC and the DC of the Strength (Athletics) check as follows: DC 12 at levels 5–10, DC 14 at levels 11–16, or DC 16 at levels 17–20.</p></div>",

It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p><p>If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic action and use a command word to activate it. It remains activated until you take a Magic action and repeat the command word to deactivate it.</p><p>Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells.

A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it.

The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.</p><p>Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a <em>Bag of Holding</em>, <em>Portable Hole</em>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.
